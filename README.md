# visualizing objects at near light speed

## info 

The goal of this project was to visualize what an object might look like when going at near light speed. 

To reach this goal, I created a site with two different simulations. The first is a ray traced sphere being transformed (index.html), and the other is a simpler length contraction simulation on 2d images (index_alt.html). Both are interactive with the slider, the furthest right position represents 0.99c.

## how to use
1. clone repo
2. (optional) serve on port 5500
3. just open the html files or goto http://localhost:5500 if running server

_navbar expects localhost server to work_
